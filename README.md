# Linear Regression Project

This is a project that was completed for UCSB Pstat 126 - Regression Analysis using the Diamonds data set from Kaggle.com. Part 1 mostly consists of sampling and cleaning and analysing the data, whereas in Part 2 we actually construct a multiple regression model in an attempt to predict future data. The model isn't perfect and the data definitely gets more unpredictable as it deviates from the mean, specifically in the positive direction, however we do find a functioning model, eventually achieving an adjusted R-squared value of **0.98**.
